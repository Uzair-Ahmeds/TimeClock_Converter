# TimeClock_Converter
TimeClock_Converter is a simple C++ program designed to convert time from the 24-hour clock notation to the 12-hour clock notation. This project allows users to input time in hours and minutes using the 24-hour clock format and then converts it to the 12-hour clock format, also indicating whether it's AM or PM.
